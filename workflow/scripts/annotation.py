    While recognizing that an enormous variety of attributes could go here in
    describing the functional annotation of a BioThing, I'm starting with those
    we most often encounter and need to be available in common output formats.
    These most common attributes are accessed by name, but the others are found
    as a dict in the 'other_attributes' property.
    Also, there's a place for having attributes like this abstracted, stored in
    ontologies, etc.  We've done all that before.  For now I'm going to try
    and hopefully enjoy the utility of having the most common properties always
    directly, and simply, available.
